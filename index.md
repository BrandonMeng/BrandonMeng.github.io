### CPSC 120

* Lab 4

Lab 4, part one, was an interesting lab I enjoyed. The basic essence was using
different conversion ratios for different measurements. We were taught to
create multiple double variables to instantiate these conversion ratios to
utilize them.

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part two, where we had to create our own blackjack game, brought
attention to my eyes. I always wanted to see the thought process when creating
such a game. With the utilization of if and bool statements, we were able to
complete such task.

*Lab 7

Lab 7, part one was a great learning experience for me, where I gained valuable
coding skills in handling date calculations. I enjoyed converting user-inputted
dates into day units and finding the difference between them. Witnessing the
instant output during testing was gratifying, reinforcing my pride in
successfully programming functionalities to tackle the specified task.
